# FoxyCart

This Hypermedia API is designed to give you complete control over your FoxyCart store. Anything you can do in the FoxyCart admin, you can also do through this API which means you can embed Foxy into any application. 
:[API Root](resources/root.apib)

# Group Client

To view and work with a client, you must be connected to the API using an OAuth token with `client_full_access` scope.

Once you create a client and connect with the `client_full_access` scope, you can then create a user or connect to an existing user using the `user_full_access` OAuth scope. Once connected to the API using an OAuth token with the `user_full_access` scope, you can create a store or connect to an existing store with the `store_full_acesss` scope.

When creating a client resource, the response will include the OAuth Access and Refresh tokens required to work with this resource via the API. It's important to save this information in your database. If you lose it, you'll have to do an OAuth Authorization Code grant via your browser.

# Group User

To modify a user, you must be connected to the API using an OAuth token with user_full_access scope.

A FoxyCart User is someone who manages and configures a FoxyCart Store. It is often the owner of that store, but might also be someone paid to be responsible for aspects of the store. There can be many users per store and any user can access many stores. Before creating a user, you must create a client. When you create a user, you'll get a response back containing an OAuth token giving you access to the user.

## User Collection [/users]

### Create a new user [POST]
When creating a user resource, the response will include the OAuth Access and Refresh tokens required to work with this resource via the API. It's important to save this information in your database. If you lose it, you'll have to do an OAuth Authorization Code grant via your browser.

# Group Store

A FoxyCart Store is your home for managing your online payment system as it relates to [FoxyCart's platform](http://www.foxycart.com/features/what-foxycart-does). One store will be used per organization selling online. You can create a store for free and use it as long as you like until you read ready to collect live payments from your customers. We also recommend setting up a development store along with your production store so you can test out new features. Before you create a store, you must create a client and a user. When creating a store, you'll get a response back containing an OAuth token giving you access to the store.

# Group Stores

## Store Collection [/users/{id}/stores]
This link relationship returns a collection of resources. You can easily paginate through this collection using the hypermedia links provided and the link relationships of first, prev, next, and last. Scroll down to view a representation of a single resource embedded within this collection.

When creating a store resource, the response will include the OAuth Access and Refresh tokens required to work with this resource via the API. It's important to save this information in your database. If you lose it, you'll have to do an OAuth Authorization Code grant via your browser.

# Group Token
The OAuth token endpoint for all access and refresh token requests. Ideally, the client should authenticate using HTTP Basic Authentication as described in the OAuth 2.0 RFC, though you can also POST the client_id and client_secret directly.

**Authorization Grant**: Once you've been granted an Authorization Code using our authorization end point (`https://my.foxycart.com/authorize`), you POST to the token endpoint with a `grant_type=authorization_code&code={authorization_code}&redirect_uri={redirect_uri}` (If not doing HTTP Basic Auth, you will have to also include the `&client_id={client_id}&client_secret={client_secret}`). The response will give you your access_token and refresh_token.

**Refresh Token**: The OAuth endpoint for obtaining a new access_token using an existing refresh_token. Access tokens expire after 7200 seconds (2 hours) and refresh tokens expire after 315360000 seconds (10 years). Post www-form-url-encoded data as follows: `grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token={refresh_token}` (If not doing HTTP Basic Auth, you will have to also include the `&client_id={client_id}&client_secret={client_secret}`).

You can also send JSON data instead of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` if you send a `Content-type: application/json` header. This token response, including both the access_token and refresh_token should be saved in your database according to your OAuth needs.

## Update an OAuth access_token [POST /token]

+ Request (application/x-www-form-urlencoded)

# Group User Access

## User Access [/user_accesses/{id}]

This resource represents a relationship between a FoxyCart store and the FoxyCart admin user who can access that store. Each user can only have one default store. If an access record for a user's default store is deleted or modified to no longer be the default, the last modified store the user has access to will become the new default store.

To add a user to a store, create a new user_access resource. To remove a user, delete their user_access resource

+ Parameters
    + id (number) - Id of an user_access.

# Group Subscription

## Subscription [/subscriptions/{id}]

A subscription is a recurring transaction. To create a subscription, you must first create the original transaction which will be run based on the item's subscription_frequency. Items on a transaction with the same subscription_frequency, subscription_startdate, and subscription_enddate will be grouped together to create a subscription. Multiple subscriptions can be created from the same original transaction.

To modify the details of a subscription such as the items involved, the amount of the subscription, the discounts in use, etc, modify the cart details linked via the transaction_template link relationship. To modify when the subscription runs, modify the frequency, next transaction dates, end dates and such directly on the subscription.

If the subscription is integrated with a third party subscription system (such as PayPal Express), there may be limitiations on what can be modified such as the next_transaction_date and frequency.

The sub_token_url link relationship will load up the subscription template into a full HTML cart for the store.

+ Parameters
    + id (number) - Id of a subscription.

# Group Tax

## Tax [/taxes/{id}]

Tax rates are determined by the customer's shipping location. If you are within the United States, you can set is_live to true to automatically calculate live tax rates based on the customer's postal code. Otherwise, you can set up global taxes which don't change based on location, country taxes which change based on the country, regional taxes which change based on the customer's state / province, and local taxes which change based on the customer's city. If the location matches, the tax rate is applied. You can also specify whether or not this tax rate should also be applied to the shipping costs.

Once a tax rate is configured, it must be applied to a item category for it to be used by creating a tax_item_category resource.

+ Parameters
    + id (number) - Id of a tax.
